Pollinator Advocates understand just how important pollinators are to food, culture, and life. They have taken that extra step to help out the birds, bees, butterflies, moths, and bats that support agriculture and ecosystems everywhere. NAPPC, through its recognition and appreciation of Pollinator Advocates, encourages their activities and hopes to catalyze future actions on behalf of pollinators. Each year the awards are given in Canada, the United States, and Mexico supporting all of the work that goes into protecting North American pollinator populations. Winners of the Pollinator Advocate Awards will be recognized at a VIP reception opening the 15th Annual North American Pollinator Protection Campaign Conference hosted at the U.S. Department of the Interior in Washington D.C., or in their hometown if they are unable to attend.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nominations are due by Friday July 24th</strong><br>
<br>
<p>The Pollinator Advocate Award recognizes  individuals or organizations that have contributed significantly to pollinator species protection and conservation and to public education, resulting in increased awareness of the importance of pollination. <br><br>

                        <p align="left">Sam Heikes and his daughter Heidi have been farming land that has been in their family since the 1900&rsquo;s with a suitable model that puts the science of crop manage first. Sam Heikes has always worked with techniques that were developed through science and understanding of ecosystem functions and the way in which economics can make or break diversified farming systems. Sam&rsquo;s motivation to support sustainable agriculture in the plains all started with sunflowers. Trained as an agronomist, Sam knew how to design cropping systems that were resilient to pests, produced high yields, and provided other ecological benefits.&nbsp; Within the wheat fields of South Dakota, efforts to improve crop yields and reduce pest infestations were being hampered by government programs that imposed production limits and crop restrictions. Sunflowers benefit wheat in many ways, and planting sunflowers after a wheat harvest would provide soil benefits and food to beneficial species like bees. Sam&rsquo;s work with colleague Don Leiblow help to remove these restrictions was successful, and now South Dakota is the number one sunflower producer in the US &ndash; and sunflowers are helping to feed the bees by providing a pollen source.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

This special award sheds light on the contributions of Canadian farmers to natural and cultural resource preservation.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Micheal, Laura, and Takota Coen have been practicing true sustainable farming since the late 1980&rsquo;s. Recently, son Takota began practicing agroforestry on their 250 acre farm near Ferintosh, Alberta. Their &ldquo;forest farm&rdquo; mimics the local Aspen Parkland Biome, allowing them to work with nature rather than against it. Just as their native northern prairie was once interspersed with groves of poplars and roamed by herds of bison, the Coens&rsquo; pastures, full of cattle, are being planted to groves of fruit, nut and timber trees. These diversified landscapes are ideal areas where local wildlife, most notably the vastly important pollinator community, thrive. Not only do pollinators gain from the increased habitat and forage but the Coens&rsquo; pastures, livestock, and edible tree crops function symbiotically to benefit all the individual elements.<br />

                        <p>When it comes to pollination one often thinks of the excitement of the journey out to California to pollinate almonds in February &ndash; nearly 70% of US bees make it out there each year.&nbsp; A beekeeper&rsquo;s work is often summarized as a mission to place bees from one crop to the next.&nbsp; BUT the real work and the incredible effort of beekeepers that provide pollination services (known in the industry as Pollinators) is to keep the bees going the rest of the year. Honey bees require proper nutrition gained through a diverse and abundant diet of mixed flowers and crops to be healthy &ndash; and they need this sort of food throughout the year. When bees aren&rsquo;t in pollination contracts beekeepers want to place them in areas of ample, clean (pesticide and chemical-free) forage. Unfortunately these areas aren&rsquo;t always present, and when they are they aren&rsquo;t always available to the bees. As with native and wild bees, a lack of habitat is the leading factor impacting the health and viability of honey bees. <br />

                        <p>The Pollinator Advocate Award recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to pollinator protection, conservation, and issue outreach resulting in increased awareness of the importance of pollinators and pollination. This year Sustaible.TO Architecture + Building is the distinguished recipient of the Pollinator Advocate Award for Canada for helping to give bees in need which need a place to rest indeed.</p>
                        <p>The loss of habitat is the main driving factor in pollinator decline, but lost habitat can be replaced by planting for pollinators and by building homes for bees. Flowers are just one part of the habitat equation for bees &ndash; a place to raise a family the other. In urban areas many of the natural places that bees might nest are unavailable, concrete covers soil, woodlots are cleared, and bees lack places to make their homes. Sustainable.TO heard the call to action and switched roles from human architect to bee developer, built five splendid bee condos that debuted across the GTA in June. Architects and interns learned how to think like a bee and put pollination biology in first place when developing these fashionable but functional designs. The flagship bee condo on the roof of the Fairmont Hotel in Toronto has drawn many visitors and helps spread the word on helping the bees.<br />

                        <p>Pablo Jaramillo has seeded the soil for successful monarch conservation in Mexico. For this reason he has been honoured as the recipient of the 2014 Pollinator Advocate Award for Mexico. Dr. Jaramillo&rsquo;s work protects monarch from the base of their habitat &ndash; the soil that sustains the trees which provide overwintering habitat for hundreds of thousands of butterflies in the Oyamel Fir Forests of Mexico. </p>
                        <p>Dr. Jaramillo works with local community members through the Monarch Butterfly Fund to protect and preserve monarch habitats by ensuring the viability of communities and ecosystems surrounding these forests. Rather than erecting barriers and preventing locals from interacting with the landscapes that support monarchs, Dr. Jaramillo works with local to support the natural function of the forest. He works with the community to transform marginal agricultural land back into productive forest using mini-grants. To his credit, more than 30 hectares of forest have begun to regenerate to monarch habitat &ndash; quite a feat when only 0.67 hectares (1.65 acres) were occupied by monarchs last year during the lowest migration numbers yet. <br />

                        The Canadian Farmer-Rancher Pollinator  Award recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to pollinator  protection, conservation, and issue outreach resulting in increased awareness  of the importance of pollinators and pollination within the agricultural  community. This special award is co-sponsored by Pollinator Partnership Canada  and the Canadian Federation for Agriculture.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Bryan Gilvesy, and his wife Cathy, started farming  tobacco in Norfolk   County in 1979.&nbsp; A declining tobacco market signaled the move  to cattle ranching. They have been raising Texas Longhorns for over fifteen  years. A sustainable land ethic always governed their operation, but in 2008 Bryan attended a  Pollination Guelph symposium where they learned about the importance of  providing pollinator habitat on farms and other areas.&nbsp; That year, they put in a 2000 ft pollinator  hedgerow and bee nesting habitat. Beef doesn&rsquo;t require pollination, but the  additional on-site and off-site benefits and ecosystem services provided by  bees, butterflies, moths, and beetles, improve the local ecology. Things just  seem to run better, and this translates into food that just tastes and feels  better.</p></td>

                        The NAPPC-NACD Farmer-Rancher Pollinator Award  recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to pollinator  protection, conservation, and issue outreach resulting in increased awareness  of the importance of pollinators and pollination within the agricultural  community. This special and new award, presented for the first time this year,  sheds light on the contributions of American farmers to natural and cultural  resource preservation. </p>
                        Pollinators  are high on the radar for Josiah and Valer Austin who have been farming and  ranching for pollinators for over a decade. The Austin&rsquo;s are working toward sustainable  models of conservation and productivity in cattle production with managed  grazing. Their goal is to promote sustainable ranching both in the United States and Mexico, ranching that feeds the  industry and supports local ecosystems. When managed correctly, reduced grazing  can have dramatic positive effects on the diversity of pollinators. The Austin&rsquo;s have promoted their pollinator grazing system on  their properties in Arizona, Texas,  Montana, and Northern   Mexico, where they also encourage pollinators by planting  pollinator-attractive vegetation and increasing nesting habitat. Their  participation in monitoring and documenting the diversity of pollinators on  their properties has established a valuable baseline for pollinator dynamics in  semi-natural environments</td>

                        Pollinators  support local ecosystems, and these ecosystems support our culture. Living  apart from nature often makes us forget that they way we speak, the foods we  eat, the art we produce, and the culture we have came to us from our natural  surrounding. This fundament fact is at the root of the cultural and landscape  preservation carried out by the Alderville First Nation Black Oak Savanna. A  simple action back in 2002, the seeding of crop land with native species, has  returned and revived not only a local landscape but an ecosystem. Today it  flourishes with partnerships: plants and people, plants and pollinators.  Sharing the landscape and working together to support community is embodied in  this program.</p></td>

                        Roque Arroyo  Rodr&iacute;guez has rediscovered the lost art of keeping stingless bees and is  playing a key role in their local conservation in Puebla, Mexico.  The traditional practice of stingless beekeeping, or meliponiculture, dates  back to Mayan times, but has significantly declined over the past few decades  and is a cultural aspect that is at risk of disappearing. Stingless bees  produce sweet, light honey from native forest plant species. Their honey is  valued both nutritionally and medicinally and can provide a viable income  source to stingless beekeepers. In 2006 Roque Arroyo Rodr&iacute;guez develop a local  stingless beekeeping cooperative, Texochco Sentekitini, in Sierra Norte de  Puebla, M&eacute;xico. The Texochco Sentekitini cooperative has twelve members that  keep bees, and has grown so much that contract pollination services can be  provided to growers of local fruits. This all generates income that can support  families and the community. Roque and Texochco Sentekitini are proving the  value of pollinator conservation and management in Mexico. </p></td>

                        In 2011,  Director Louie Schwartzberg composed a beautiful love story that is in danger. Pollinators  and plants have evolved over millions of years to be codependent. Our future  depends on this love story between the flowers and pollinators because more  than 90% of our food wouldn&rsquo;t make it to our plate without them and nearly  every terrestrial landscape would senesce. In Wings of Life, Louie Schwartzberg  presented this message of our total dependence on pollinators with splendor and  grace. Audiences were stunned by the beauty and came away with a deeper  understanding of why we need to protect these natural resources. The Paul  Growald Media Award is a special award that is not presented every year.  Pollinator Partnership awards this honor only when a Pollinator Advocate uses  power of media to support pollinators. <em>Wings  of Life</em> is a true representation of how powerful a deeper look at plants  and their pollinators can, acting as a global call to action for their  conservation. </p></td>

                              Ms. Malach was the driving force behind the first ever Canadian  Pollinator Week celebrated July 21 to July 26, 2010 across the city of Toronto.  Pollinator Week activities included public lectures by Dr. Lawrence Parker, a  global expert on bees; artistic instillations highlighting pollinator species;  and guided pollinator safari tours in the Brickworks park lands. Visitors to  the event took away more then just an appreciation for pollinators in the city  &ndash; the learnt how they could become partners in a growing effort to conserve  pollinating species in landscapes across North America.  Ms. Malach is already working on plans for Pollinator Week 2011.</div></td>

                              Dr. Horn has worked for years with honey bees and has been a true  advocate of their conservation and protection.  Her recent efforts in Appalachian coal country with apiforestation has gained  her this recognition. Dr. Horn has been able to work across disciplines and has  brought together multiple stakeholders that often have divergent interests, all  for the sake of honey bees. The practice of reclaiming coal mine lands by  planting trees, shrubs and other vegetation and establishing healthy working  &ldquo;beeyards&rdquo; is now in place and strong partnerships have been developed between  unlikely parties. </div></td>
