        	<p>Pollinator Advocates understand just how important pollinators are to food, culture, and life. They have taken that extra step to help out the birds, bees, butterflies, moths, and bats that support agriculture and ecosystems everywhere. NAPPC, through its recognition and appreciation of Pollinator Advocates, encourages their activities and hopes to catalyze future actions on behalf of pollinators. Each year the awards are given in Canada, the United States, and Mexico supporting all of the work that goes into protecting North American pollinator populations. Winners of the Pollinator Advocate Awards will be recognized at a VIP reception opening the 15th Annual North American Pollinator Protection Campaign Conference hosted at the U.S. Department of the Interior in Washington D.C., or in their hometown if they are unable to attend.

        			<div class="meta-data">Farmer-Rancher Pollinator Advocate USA 2014</div>
        			<p>The NAPPC-NACD Farmer-Rancher Pollinator Award recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to pollinator protection, conservation, and issue outreach resulting in increased awareness of the importance of pollinators and pollination within the agricultural community. This special award sheds light on the contributions of American farmers to natural and cultural resource preservation.</p>
        			<p>Sam Heikes and his daughter Heidi have been farming land that has been in their family since the 1900’s with a suitable model that puts the science of crop manage first. Sam Heikes has always worked with techniques that were developed through science and understanding of ecosystem functions and the way in which economics can make or break diversified farming systems. Sam’s motivation to support sustainable agriculture in the plains all started with sunflowers. Trained as an agronomist, Sam knew how to design cropping systems that were resilient to pests, produced high yields, and provided other ecological benefits.  Within the wheat fields of South Dakota, efforts to improve crop yields and reduce pest infestations were being hampered by government programs that imposed production limits and crop restrictions. Sunflowers benefit wheat in many ways, and planting sunflowers after a wheat harvest would provide soil benefits and food to beneficial species like bees. Sam’s work with colleague Don Leiblow help to remove these restrictions was successful, and now South Dakota is the number one sunflower producer in the US – and sunflowers are helping to feed the bees by providing a pollen source. </p>

        			<div class="meta-data">Pollinator Advocate 2014</div>
        			<p>The Pollinator Advocate Award recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to pollinator protection, conservation, and issue outreach resulting in increased awareness of the importance of pollinators and pollination. This year Sustaible.TO Architecture + Building is the distinguished recipient of the Pollinator Advocate Award for Canada for helping to give bees in need which need a place to rest indeed.</p>
        			<p>The loss of habitat is the main driving factor in pollinator decline, but lost habitat can be replaced by planting for pollinators and by building homes for bees. Flowers are just one part of the habitat equation for bees – a place to raise a family the other. In urban areas many of the natural places that bees might nest are unavailable, concrete covers soil, woodlots are cleared, and bees lack places to make their homes. Sustainable.TO heard the call to action and switched roles from human architect to bee developer, built five splendid bee condos that debuted across the GTA in June. Architects and interns learned how to think like a bee and put pollination biology in first place when developing these fashionable but functional designs. The flagship bee condo on the roof of the Fairmont Hotel in Toronto has drawn many visitors and helps spread the word on helping the bees.</p>

        			<div class="meta-data">Pollinator Advocate Mexico 2014</div>
        			<p>Pablo Jaramillo has seeded the soil for successful monarch conservation in Mexico. For this reason he has been honoured as the recipient of the 2014 Pollinator Advocate Award for Mexico. Dr. Jaramillo’s work protects monarch from the base of their habitat – the soil that sustains the trees which provide overwintering habitat for hundreds of thousands of butterflies in the Oyamel Fir Forests of Mexico.</p>
        			<p>Dr. Jaramillo works with local community members through the Monarch Butterfly Fund to protect and preserve monarch habitats by ensuring the viability of communities and ecosystems surrounding these forests. Rather than erecting barriers and preventing locals from interacting with the landscapes that support monarchs, Dr. Jaramillo works with local to support the natural function of the forest. He works with the community to transform marginal agricultural land back into productive forest using mini-grants. To his credit, more than 30 hectares of forest have begun to regenerate to monarch habitat – quite a feat when only 0.67 hectares (1.65 acres) were occupied by monarchs last year during the lowest migration numbers yet. </p>

        			<div class="meta-data">Farmer-Rancher Pollinator Advocate Canada 2013</div>

        			<p>The Canadian Farmer-Rancher Pollinator Award recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to pollinator protection, conservation, and issue outreach resulting in increased awareness of the importance of pollinators and pollination within the agricultural community. This special award is co-sponsored by Pollinator Partnership Canada and the Canadian Federation for Agriculture.</p>
        			<p>Bryan Gilvesy, and his wife Cathy, started farming tobacco in Norfolk County in 1979.  A declining tobacco market signaled the move to cattle ranching. They have been raising Texas Longhorns for over fifteen years. A sustainable land ethic always governed their operation, but in 2008 Bryan attended a Pollination Guelph symposium where they learned about the importance of providing pollinator habitat on farms and other areas.  That year, they put in a 2000 ft pollinator hedgerow and bee nesting habitat. Beef doesn’t require pollination, but the additional on-site and off-site benefits and ecosystem services provided by bees, butterflies, moths, and beetles, improve the local ecology. Things just seem to run better, and this translates into food that just tastes and feels better.</p>

        			<div class="meta-data">Farmer-Rancher Pollinator Advocate USA</div>
        			<p>The NAPPC-NACD Farmer-Rancher Pollinator Award recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to pollinator protection, conservation, and issue outreach resulting in increased awareness of the importance of pollinators and pollination within the agricultural community. This special and new award, presented for the first time this year, sheds light on the contributions of American farmers to natural and cultural resource preservation.
        			</p>
        			<p>Pollinators are high on the radar for Josiah and Valer Austin who have been farming and ranching for pollinators for over a decade. The Austin’s are working toward sustainable models of conservation and productivity in cattle production with managed grazing. Their goal is to promote sustainable ranching both in the United States and Mexico, ranching that feeds the industry and supports local ecosystems. When managed correctly, reduced grazing can have dramatic positive effects on the diversity of pollinators. The Austin’s have promoted their pollinator grazing system on their properties in Arizona, Texas, Montana, and Northern Mexico, where they also encourage pollinators by planting pollinator-attractive vegetation and increasing nesting habitat. Their participation in monitoring and documenting the diversity of pollinators on their properties has established a valuable baseline for pollinator dynamics in semi-natural environments.

        			<p>Pollinators support local ecosystems, and these ecosystems support our culture. Living apart from nature often makes us forget that they way we speak, the foods we eat, the art we produce, and the culture we have came to us from our natural surrounding. This fundament fact is at the root of the cultural and landscape preservation carried out by the Alderville First Nation Black Oak Savanna. A simple action back in 2002, the seeding of crop land with native species, has returned and revived not only a local landscape but an ecosystem. Today it flourishes with partnerships: plants and people, plants and pollinators. Sharing the landscape and working together to support community is embodied in this program.

        			<p>Pollinators support local ecosystems, and these ecosystems support our culture. Living apart from nature often makes us forget that they way we speak, the foods we eat, the art we produce, and the culture we have came to us from our natural surrounding. This fundament fact is at the root of the cultural and landscape preservation carried out by the Alderville First Nation Black Oak Savanna. A simple action back in 2002, the seeding of crop land with native species, has returned and revived not only a local landscape but an ecosystem. Today it flourishes with partnerships: plants and people, plants and pollinators. Sharing the landscape and working together to support community is embodied in this program.

        			<p>Roque Arroyo Rodríguez has rediscovered the lost art of keeping stingless bees and is playing a key role in their local conservation in Puebla, Mexico. The traditional practice of stingless beekeeping, or meliponiculture, dates back to Mayan times, but has significantly declined over the past few decades and is a cultural aspect that is at risk of disappearing. Stingless bees produce sweet, light honey from native forest plant species. Their honey is valued both nutritionally and medicinally and can provide a viable income source to stingless beekeepers. In 2006 Roque Arroyo Rodríguez develop a local stingless beekeeping cooperative, Texochco Sentekitini, in Sierra Norte de Puebla, México. The Texochco Sentekitini cooperative has twelve members that keep bees, and has grown so much that contract pollination services can be provided to growers of local fruits. This all generates income that can support families and the community. Roque and Texochco Sentekitini are proving the value of pollinator conservation and management in Mexico.

        			<p>In 2011, Director Louie Schwartzberg composed a beautiful love story that is in danger. Pollinators and plants have evolved over millions of years to be codependent. Our future depends on this love story between the flowers and pollinators because more than 90% of our food wouldn’t make it to our plate without them and nearly every terrestrial landscape would senesce. In Wings of Life, Louie Schwartzberg presented this message of our total dependence on pollinators with splendor and grace. Audiences were stunned by the beauty and came away with a deeper understanding of why we need to protect these natural resources. The Paul Growald Media Award is a special award that is not presented every year. Pollinator Partnership awards this honor only when a Pollinator Advocate uses power of media to support pollinators. Wings of Life is a true representation of how powerful a deeper look at plants and their pollinators can, acting as a global call to action for their conservation.

        			<p>The Ruzicka’s have been practicing sustainable farming since the mid 90’s, long before organic agriculture and ecologically functional farmscapes were popularized. Pollinators became a solid part of their conservation focus when cases of CCD started appearing south of the boarder in the United Sates and they became aware of the critical roles that pollinators play in agricultural systems. This plugged Don and Marie into the connection that all members of the agricultural community have with pollinators.</p>

As a result, many other landowners have begun planting pollinator habitat on their own property. Peter also helped secure many of the pollinator planting guidelines present in new Conservation Reserve Program across the United States, doing significant work in Washington DC to ensure that polliatnors remain a key concern for conservation programming. To this end Peter has served as a speaker at meetings across the country to help educate stakeholders and decision-makers about the importance of pollinators and pollinator habitat, working to help them use and implement Farm Bill provisions to better the landscape for pollinators.</p>
