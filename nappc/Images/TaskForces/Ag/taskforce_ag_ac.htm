                    Meet Farmer Alfred Courchesne, affectionately known as  Farmer Al, owner and operator of Frog Hollow Farms.</p>
                    <p>Prior to becoming a farmer, Al was a high school history  teacher in Hawaii. Al forayed into the  agricultural world when a friend inspired him to become a papaya farmer on the Big Island.  Thirty odd years later, Al is in his trusty golf  cart roaming his 145 acres of orchards, nestled among a diverse community of  small farmers in Brentwood, Contra    Costa County, California.  Al owns and operates an organic fruit farm that produces plums, pluots, olives,  nectarines, pomegranates, oranges, cherries, apples, and pears. His true claim  to fame is the 30+ varieties of peaches that make up the majority of his  acreage. <br />

                  <td width="483" valign="top">In addition to fresh fruit, Frog Hollow Farms has an onsite  industrial kitchen that produces granola, pastries, and preserves. The kitchen  is run by Al&rsquo;s wife Rebecca Courchesne who has worked for Alice Water's Cafe  Fanny and as head pastry chef at Oliveto in Oakland.<br />
                    <br />
Al is not only a farmer, but also a nature lover and a land  steward. Al invests in pollinator promotion to increase the quantity and  quality of his fruit production. Some of his crops are dependent on bee  pollination for reproduction, while others benefit from increased yields from  supplemental bee services.&nbsp; On a personal  level, Al loves the idea of creating biodiversity by providing habitat for  native flora and fauna. In his words, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting to connect  with nature!&rdquo; <br />

              <p class="style107"><strong>Pollinator Awareness</strong></p>
              <p>Since the beginning of his agricultural career, Al has been  concerned with pollination services on his farm. His apple, plum, and cherry  trees depend on bee pollination for fruit production. Other fruit trees like  peaches, nectarines, and pluots can increase yields when bees supplement  pollination. Without bees to pollinate, Al could lose half his fruit! Like most  farmers, Al depends predominately on the European honey bee for these services.  To enhance the production of his fruit trees and to promote bee populations, Al  established resident hives on his farm with help from a local beekeeper. Frog  Hollow now houses over 70 honey beehives year round attended by a contract  beekeeper.<br />

                <tr>
                  <td width="460" valign="top"><p>In 2009, Al was introduced to Dr. Gordon Frankie, head of  the University of California, Berkeley Urban Bee Lab, by  Alyson Aquino from the Contra Costa County USDA-Natural Resource and  Conservation Service (NRCS). Dr. Frankie has over 25 years of experience  working with and studying California native  bees. Twelve years of survey research in urban gardens in ten cities throughout  of California has given the Urban Bee Lab  extensive insight into bee-plant relationships. Using this knowledge, Dr.  Frankie is able to recommend the best bee plants for Al's pollination needs. </p>
                    While Al had been aware of native bees prior to  meeting Dr. Frankie, he had not yet taken extra steps to promote their  populations on his farm. Forming a strong partnership, Al, NRCS, and Dr.  Frankie&rsquo;s team began a project to promote native bees and their habitats in  agricultural areas. This project is now known as <em>Farming for Native Bees</em> and involves partnerships with 7 small  farmers in Brentwood, all of who are  interested in promoting native pollinators (see <a href="http://www.helpabee.org/farming-for-native-bees.html" target="_blank"><em>http://www.helpabee.org/farming-for-native-bees.html</em></a>) <br />

              <p>Al has been one of the biggest proponents of <em>Farming for Native Bees </em>and has been  invaluable in providing many opportunities to promote native pollinators on his  farm and in the community (see <em>Native Bee  Floral Resources </em>and <em>Reactions</em> for more information). As Dr. Frankie has said, &ldquo;Al is great because he is a  risk-taker. He isn&rsquo;t afraid to learn from failures. Groundbreaking projects  like <em>Farming for Native Bees</em> need  people like Al to make them a reality.&rdquo;<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style107"><strong>Native Bee Floral Resources</strong></p>
              <p>Beginning in 2010, under the guidance of Dr. Frankie&rsquo;s team,  Al and his workers  have progressively installed perennial plants  that attract native bees (bee plants) in two hedgerows along the southern  border of his peach orchards  and at the end of several  orchard rows. <img src="Images/TaskForces/Ag/ac2.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="130" align="right" /> Additionally,California  native annuals, such as Californiapoppies (<em>Eschscholzia californica)</em> and <em>Phacelia </em>species have been seeded  extensively between orchard rows  Excited by early results  and the beauty of the bee plants, Al has progressively volunteered more and  more space on his farm for native bee habitat. As of December 2012, Al has  installed over 150 individual plants from approximately 45 plant types  (includes species, varieties, and cultivars) within and along Frog Hollow&rsquo;s  borders. These plants have proven to be such an attractive and abundant supply  of floral resources that nearly all of Al&rsquo;s resident honey bee hives have been  moved adjacent to the bee plant hedgerows.<img src="Images/TaskForces/Ag/ac4.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="229" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="left" /></p>
              <p>In addition to installing bee plants, Al allows weedy plants  to grow in between tree rows and unused areas of his orchards, only removing  them when they interfere with irrigation. Weeds attractive to bees, such as  bristly ox-tongue (<em>Picris echioides)</em> and wild mustards (<em>Brassica </em>species),  provide supplemental floral resources when other more attractive sources are  unavailable. Occasionally Al will plant a cover crop, such as clover (<em>Trifolium </em>species), to fix nitrogen for  his fruit trees as well as provide a coveted source of pollen and nectar for  honey bees.</p>
              <p>For the research aspect of <em>Farming for Native Bees, </em>Dr. Frankie and his team perform three  yearly monitoring studies during peak bee seasons. These studies are designed  to evaluate the success of established native bee habitat by quantifying  changes in diversity and abundance of native bee species visiting and passing  through the study farms. In the three years Frog Hollow has been adding native  bee habitat, bee species diversity has increased from eleven species in 2010 to  nearly 40 in 2011 and 2012.<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="style107"><strong>Native Bee Nesting Habitat</strong><img src="Images/TaskForces/Ag/ac3.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="232" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right" /></p>
              <p>Planting bee plants on his farm may be attracting native  bees, but Al knew if he wanted to encourage the bees to stick around and  pollinate his crops, he needed to provide them with a place to call home. To do  this, Al has left bare dirt areas available for ground nesting bees like sweat  bees (family Halictidae)  and mining bees (family Andrenidae) to burrow in to. For cavity nesters such as  leafcutter and mason bees (family Megachilidae), Al has placed bee blocks,  wooden blocks with small holes drilled into them, throughout his pear orchards  (honey bees do not visit pear trees) for them to make their brood cells in. </p>
              <p>One of the best-known native bee pollinators is the blue orchard bee (<em>Osmia lignaria</em>). They are effective  pollinators of crops such as cherries, almonds, and apples.&nbsp; For this reason, Al has an interest in  attracting them to his farm. Although they are cavity nesters, blue orchard  bees require mud to line and seal their brood cells. With the help of Dr.  Frankie&rsquo;s team, Al will be installing ephemeral mud puddles near his bee blocks  to encourage these remarkable pollinators to nest on his farm. <br />

                  <td><p class="style107"><strong>Challenges </strong> </p>
                    <p>The three years Al has been involved with <em>Farming for Native Bees</em> have been filled with trial and error and  throughout he has learned a lot. Many of the early project plants have<span class="style107"><strong><img src="Images/TaskForces/Ag/ac6.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="236" hspace="5" vspace="0" align="left" /></strong></span> been  lost to frost, extreme heat, and most of all, gophers. Gophers have by far been  the greatest challenge to establishing native bee habitat, with the voracious  rodents taking out nearly 30% of the installed plants since 2010. They have not  discriminated between plants just put into the ground and ones that have been  established for two years. In 2012, Frog Hollow&rsquo;s gopher population destroyed  three chaste berry trees (<em>Vitex  agnus-castus</em>) that had grown to over 6 feet tall. Gophers have also  attacked Al&rsquo;s fruit trees, destroying 23 of his 230 newly planted peach trees. </p>
                    <p>To circumvent gopher attacks, Al and Dr. Frankie&rsquo;s team have  selected a number of gopher resistant plant species, such as sages (<em>Salvia </em>species) and lavenders (<em>Lavandula </em>species), to install in the  hedgerows. To protect bee plants that attract gophers, gopher screens (wire  bags with small openings for root growth) are placed around the main root ball  to protect the root crown from hungry gophers. Gopher screens are a recent  development and are not yet widely distributed. Al supplements the gopher  screens in protecting his orchards and bee plants with a farm worker patrolling  with a shotgun. </p></td>

Without  hesitation, Al has adopted pollinator friendly practices and has readily  adapted his farm practices to accommodate them. To nearly every suggestion from  Dr. Frankie&rsquo;s team, whether seeding more rows with annuals or altering his  watering regime to accommodate ornamental plants, Al simply responds, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do  it.&rdquo; In his opinion, the economic and aesthetic benefits are reason enough to  undertake such measures, but he also is proud to contribute to research  dedicated to learning more about native pollinators and their importance in  California agriculture. </p>
              <p>Public response to his pollinator friendly practices has  been overwhelmingly positive. Each year Al hosts a farm tour of his normally  private orchards called the Blossom Walk. During this popular event, members of  the Brentwood community can stroll among the blooming peach trees while  listening to Al&rsquo;s contracted beekeeper and members of Dr. Frankie&rsquo;s Bee team  talk about Frog Hollow&rsquo;s pollinator work. Each year more people  sign up to tour Al&rsquo;s beautiful orchards and learn about bees; in 2010 and 2011  over 60 people attended and in 2013 they received full registration of 100  people! This tremendously positive response is only more motivation for Al to  continue helping pollinators. </p>
              <p>When asked if he would do it all again, Al immediately  responds, &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; <br />

                <li>Protect pollinator attractive plants from  gophers. It will save a lot of time and money that would be dedicated to  replacing plants.</li>
                <li>&quot;<em>Just  do it!&quot; </em>With the economic, environmental, and aesthetic benefits to  farms, Al cannot think of a reason why other farmers should not adopt  pollinator friendly practices. <br />
              </li>
              </ul>
