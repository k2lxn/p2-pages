          <h3>About the Organization</h3>
          <p>The Pollinator Partnership (P2) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
works to protect the health of managed and native pollinating animals
vital to wildland and agricultural ecosystems. Founded in 1997, P2 has
grown and achieved national status as a leader in pollinator
conservation which emphasizes progress and is based in science. The
multifaceted approach of targeting stakeholders ranging from farmers,
growers, policy makers, industry, academia, education, and the general
public has allowed P2 to form strong partnerships with institutions,
organizations, corporations, and individuals that share a general
concern for the conservation of biological diversity and the species
that provide essential ecosystem services. The targeted focus on
pollinators, however, is unique and is complemented by working
relationships and alliances with other conservation institutions.</p>
		  <p>As the parent organization of the North American Pollinator Protection Campaign (NAPPC) and in partnership
with NAPPC partners, P2 includes in its successes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>the signing of 11 major working pollinator-protection agreements with federal government agencies responsible for more than 1.5 billion acres of federally managed-influenced land</p></li>
				<li><p>participation in the 2008 Farm Bill to include pollinator programs in conservation and research titles</p></li>
				<li><p>working with the USDA Secretary of Agriculture and with the US Senate to create “National Pollinator Week” at both federal and state levels</p></li>
				<li><p>awarding research grants to learn about aspects of health for the crisis-threatened honey bee</p></li>
				<li><p>development of 31 web-based eco-regional planting guides for all regions of the U.S. to prepare the way for healthy pollinator-friendly landscapes across millions of farms, homes, schools, parks and corporate landscapes</p></li>
				<li><p>promotion of importance of pollinators to food producers and retailers reliant upon these animals for their products</p></li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          <br>
          <h3>Compensation and Location</h3>
          <p>P2 offers an excellent benefits package and a competitive salary commensurate with experience. Uniquely, this organization has benefited since its inception from a financial contribution from the current Executive Director in the form of a reduced salary; this is not the expectation for the successor. This position will ideally be located in Washington, DC or San Francisco, CA. Alternative locations may be considered, though it is expected that the Executive Director will initially spend significant time in the San Francisco office on organizational management and transitional issues as needed.</p>
          <br>
