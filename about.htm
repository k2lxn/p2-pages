                                        <p>Amber is a nature enthusiast who holds both a Bachelor and Master of Science in Biology, from the University of Akron. While her undergrad focused on Zoology, she has since broadened her interests through volunteer work and field positions. As a Field Botanist for the Cleveland Metroparks she contributed toward the long-term PCAP (Plant Community Assessment Program), which sparked an interest in vegetative research and the use of native plants in gardening and restoration projects. The following summer she was chosen to participate in the Chicago Botanic Garden’s Conservation and Land Management Internship as a Wildlife Technician. While stationed in Cedar City, Utah, she worked with the local Bureau of Land Management field office on several wildlife projects including greater sage-grouse conservation work, raptor nest surveys, Utah prairie dog studies, as well as several rangeland and riparian ecosystem health assessments. She is excited to bring her plant and wildlife experience together for the Pollinator Partnership as she monitors plant-pollinator relationships through the Bee Buffer and Monarch Wings Across Ohio programs. In her spare time she enjoys hiking, photography, and volunteering. </p>

                                      <p>Lindsay’s interest in plants and nature stemmed from gardening weekly with her mom at a young age. She expanded her interest to pollinators while assisting Dr. Vicki Wojcik on her dissertation on how habitat is used by bees in urban landscapes and what factors make a particular site more attractive to local bees. In addition, Lindsay has also worked as a Program Assistant at the Chinatown Public Health Center, Nutrition Services, for the Network for a Healthy California—Chinese Project, which strives to empower the low-income Chinese community in San Francisco to improve their nutritional and physical well-being. Through working at both organizations, Lindsay has had the opportunity to connect food production systems (P2) with public education on proper nutrition, drawing healthy environments and healthy living together. She has a Bachelors of Arts in Molecular & Cell Biology with an emphasis in Cell & Developmental Biology: Physiology from the University of California, Berkeley. In her spare time, she loves to cook, bake, garden, and spend time with her dog and rabbit. </p>
